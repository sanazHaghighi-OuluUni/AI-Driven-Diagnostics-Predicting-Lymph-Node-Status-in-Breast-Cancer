Research Project & Publication | IIEC 2025

🎯 Overview
This project focuses on predicting Axillary Lymph Node (ALN) status in breast cancer patients. By using advanced Machine Learning, we aim to reduce unnecessary invasive surgeries and improve treatment planning accuracy.

🚀 Key Achievements

Advanced Modeling: Developed a Stacking Ensemble model combining ANN, SVM, KNN, RF, and Logistic Regression.



High Accuracy: Achieved 95.08% sensitivity and specificity by integrating biopsy and imaging data into the models.


Feature Engineering: Identified 8 critical pathological variables using the Weighted by Relief method.

📜 Publication

Title: Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Status in Women with Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning Models and Stacking Approach.


Conference: 20th Iranian International Industrial Engineering Conference (IIEC 2025).


Authors: Sanaz Haghighi, Ali Hariri, Alireza Shadman, Soodabeh ShahidSales.

🛠 Tech Stack

Software: RapidMiner, SPSS.

💡 Product & Strategic Value
Unlike standalone imaging methods which often struggle with low specificity , this model offers a low-cost, high-speed, 
and non-invasive alternative that can be integrated into hospital management systems (Industry 4.0 in Healthcare).




Techniques: Cross-Validation (CV), Expectation-Maximization (EM), Stacking Approach.
